To rename android meterpreter copy these scripts into a clone of 
metasploit-payloads repository.

You can check for metasploit strings and directories using the
check scripts, and modify using non check scripts.

Simply execute the scripts with Bash. To create your own name replace
amo with a string of your own choice.

Use Apache Maven to compile Android meterpreter as instructed in metasploit-payloads.
